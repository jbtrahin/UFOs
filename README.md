# UFOs
Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

## Module Overview
In this module, you will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. To be successful in this module, youâ€™ll need to apply your HTML and Bootstrap skills and have an open mind regarding semicolons.

## Project Overview
In this challenge, you will create additional filters for the webpage. The advanced filtering capability will allow users to filter the data by multiple factors.

The goals for this challenge are to:
1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
2. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Resources

- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.39.0
- Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## App Preview

Here is a preview of what the web app looks like once all the new filters have been created and are functional:

## Recommendations for further development

Here are some suggestions on what I'd like to tackle next:
- Have the sightings data populate table tableData in a dynamic manner (through another website's API for example).
- Expand the search filter options to the other columns available in the table.
- Turn out text filter into drop-down lists to constrain and guide users to the right inputs
- We could enable the "enter" keyboard key as way to trigger the search button instead of having to press the button with the mouse.
- Create a search functionality for the comments column and pair it to a search bar.
